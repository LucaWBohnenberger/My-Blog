        "In this post, we will implement an Autoregressive Neural Network from scratch, relying solely on the PyTorch tensor class. We assume prior familiarity with Neural Networks; however, if your knowledge feels a bit rusty or you need a refresher, I recommend reading this post beforehand [Building Neural Networks from Scratch](../nn-from-scratch-1/index.qmd). \n",
        "\n",
        "The main reason for this is to learn how an Autoregressive NN works to generate words, for this, I'm drawing on Andrej Karpathy's video series about [makemore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaCmpygFfXo&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&index=2), a network capable of creating more words of the same type, so if you train with names, it generates more proper names it generates more words that remember proper names, and so on with anything that is formed by letters.\n",

It's important because we need some baseline to compare with our future models, so we will create a model called bigram, the logic is just to look to the last character. Note that you will use just one character of context for our model, and we will consider that the most small part of our word is a character, for models like chatGPT, they don't use characters, they use combinations of characters similar to syllables.\n",
