## Welcome to my Digital Notebook

I am a **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** student at PUCRS and a researcher at **NAIA**, where I focus on **Applied Research in Large Language Models (LLMs)**. 

### Why this blog?

This space serves as a **repository for my studies and technical reflections**. My main goal is to document my learning journey in a **didactic way**, transforming dense academic notes into clear, structured, and accessible content. 

Whether you are a fellow student or a researcher, I hope my notes can help demystify the "black box" of AI for you as they do for me.
