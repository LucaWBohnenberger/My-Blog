    "text": "Basic knowledge of derivative\nSo, from the start, to make sense at how an NN train and learn something, you first need a very good understanding around the meaning of derivative operations. A derivative is an operation that gives us a formula that describes the slope of a function as it modifies a variable, but for out propose, we will only work with functions that generate linear derivatives. Thus, for the function \\(f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5\\), see the graph below.\n\n\nShow Python code\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Define the function\ndef f(x):\n    return 3*x**2 - 4*x + 5\n\n# Generate x values\nx = np.linspace(-5, 5, 400)\ny = f(x)\n\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\nplt.plot(x, y, label=r\"$f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5$\")\nplt.axhline(0, color=\"black\", linewidth=0.5)\nplt.axvline(0, color=\"black\", linewidth=0.5)\nplt.xlabel(\"x\")\nplt.ylabel(\"f(x)\")\nplt.title(\"Graph of the function\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function is easy to undestand and derivate analytic, the derivate is \\(\\frac{df(x)}{dx} = 6x - 4\\). Plotting both function and his derivate, we get the graphic below.\n\n\nShow Python code\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Define the function\ndef f(x):\n    return 3*x**2 - 4*x + 5\n\ndef df(x):\n    return 6*x - 4\n\n# Generate x values\nx = np.linspace(-5, 5, 400)\ny = f(x)\ny2 = df(x)\n\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\nplt.plot(x, y, label=r\"$f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5$\")\nplt.plot(x, y2, label=r\"$df(x) = 6*x - 4$\")\nplt.axhline(0, color=\"black\", linewidth=0.5)\nplt.axvline(0, color=\"black\", linewidth=0.5)\nplt.xlabel(\"x\")\nplt.ylabel(\"f(x)\")\nplt.title(\"Graph of the function\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe basic idea is that with we want to minimize the value of a function (main objective in deep learning), we just need to see the value of a derivative in some point A, that give us all the information we need to go to the minimum spot. Just do some numerical example, in the graph above, note that the minimum spot is in some value around 0 and 2, more close to 0 (precisely 2/3), so, just pick some random number, like -2, the value of \\(f(x)\\) with -2 is 25, and the derivative is -16. The number -16 represent the rate at which the function varies for each increase in the value of x at that point in specific. So, with we increase the value of X a little bit, we can lower the value of X, so probably, the \\(f(-1.999)\\) give us a lower value than \\(f(-2)\\)\n\ndef f(x):\n    return 3*x**2 - 4*x + 5\n\nprint(\"f(-2)=\",f(-2))\nprint(\"f(-1.999)=\",f(-1.999))\n\nf(-2)= 25\nf(-1.999)= 24.984003\n\n\nThis is the general idea of how we can minimize some function, that is also the main idea of how gradient descendent works."

Our goal its make an class that can calc for us all the gradients (its the same as an derivative) from the function \\(L = -2 \\cdot \\big((2 \\cdot 3) + 10\\big)\\). But we don’t are comfortable derivate something with just numbers, so lets consider in this way the function:\n\na = 2\nb = -3.0\nc = 10\nf = -2\ne = a*b\nd = e + c\nL = d * f\nL\n\n-8.0\n\n\nJust to make clear, the knowledge that we want with this, is ow much changes in the final result, increase the values of any of the variables a little To get the gradients, we can use an approximate that consists in adding a very small number \\(h\\) is all of the values, than subtract the new with the original, and divide by the \\(h\\). The code below shows how to do this with the variable \\(a\\):\n\na = 2\nb = -3.0\nc = 10\nf = -2\ne = a*b\nd = e + c\nL = d * f\n\nh = 0.0001\na = 2 + h\nb = -3.0\nc = 10 \nf = -2\ne = a*b\nd = e + c\nL2 = d * f\n\nprint(f\"L(2) = {L}\")\nprint(f\"L({a}) = {L2}\")\nprint(f\"The slope/gradient: {(L2 - L)/h}\")\n\nL(2) = -8.0\nL(2.0001) = -7.999399999999998\nThe slope/gradient: 6.000000000021544\n\n\nWe will not use this method to create our autograd, but we can use this to verify with our gradients are right."

From the chain of rule, we have the expression below: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial e} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial d} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial e}\n\\] Bascially, it´s saying that the gradient of \\(e\\) in relation with \\(L\\) it´s just the gradient of \\(d\\) in relation with \\(L\\) time \\(e\\) in relation with \\(d\\). This mean that we only have to calc the local gradient \\(\\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial e}\\) because we already have calc the \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial d}\\) and its save in d.grad. The same with \\(c\\) it´s true. So, from calculus, the gradient from an expression like \\(f(x,y) = x + y\\) its 1 for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Thus, we have\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial e} = 1\n\\quad \\text{and}  \\quad\n\\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial c} = 1\n\\] \\[\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial e} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial d} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial e} = -2 \\cdot 1 = -2\n\\quad \\text{and}  \\quad\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial e} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial d} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial c} = -2 \\cdot 1 = -2\n\\]\nThis is the strong concept that make the AutoGrad work, we only need to calc the local gradient and multiply with the gradient from the father of nodes (because the gradient of the father already is in relation with the last node).\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n%3\n\n\n\n124429910967392\n\nc\n\ndata 10.0000\n\ngrad -2.0000\n\n\n\n124429910977856+\n\n+\n\n\n\n124429910967392-&gt;124429910977856+\n\n\n\n\n\n124429910975168\n\nf\n\ndata -2.0000\n\ngrad 4.0000\n\n\n\n124429910968160*\n\n*\n\n\n\n124429910975168-&gt;124429910968160*\n\n\n\n\n\n124429910980304\n\ne\n\ndata -6.0000\n\ngrad -2.0000\n\n\n\n124429910980304-&gt;124429910977856+\n\n\n\n\n\n124429910980304*\n\n*\n\n\n\n124429910980304*-&gt;124429910980304\n\n\n\n\n\n124429910977856\n\nd\n\ndata 4.0000\n\ngrad -2.0000\n\n\n\n124429910977856-&gt;124429910968160*\n\n\n\n\n\n124429910977856+-&gt;124429910977856\n\n\n\n\n\n124429910968160\n\nL\n\ndata -8.0000\n\ngrad 1.0000\n\n\n\n124429910968160*-&gt;124429910968160\n\n\n\n\n\n124429910976896\n\nb\n\ndata -3.0000\n\ngrad 0.0000\n\n\n\n124429910976896-&gt;124429910980304*\n\n\n\n\n\n124429910981552\n\na\n\ndata 2.0000\n\ngrad 0.0000\n\n\n\n124429910981552-&gt;124429910980304*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo for the last two variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), its another multiplication, so the local grad of \\(b\\) its data of \\(a\\), and for \\(a\\) its data from \\(b\\).

    "text": "Lets make our Deep Learning framework\n\nBuilding a Neuron\nSo, for now, we have already created our own engine to calculate our gradients. Thus, lets start making a simple artificial neuron. If you don’t know or don’t remember how a neuron work, basically it receives inputs, multiply each one by some weight, sum all values, and last, pass this value in a non-linear function\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An Artificial Neuron\n\n\n\nTo start, we can make a simple class for our neuron:\n\nimport random\nclass Neuron:\n    def __init__(self, input_num):\n        self.w = [Value(random.uniform(-1,1)) for _ in range(input_num)] # This basicaly creates a list of Value's from a uniform distribuition with lenth equals to input_num\n        self.b = Value(random.uniform(-1,1)) # This is for the bias, explain deeply the importance of this is out of scope, but you can think bias its just a special weight that dosnt multiply the inputs, just sum in the sum part.\n\n    # Call is a special function in python, its like __add__, the sintax for use this is when you just put () after the object, like range(x)\n    def __call__(self,x):\n        act = sum((wi*xi for wi,xi in zip(self.w, x)), self.b) # This just do the calculation of a neuron until the sum part\n        out = act.tahn() # This calls a non-linear function from the Value class, I will show how to implement bellow\n        return out\n    \n    def parameters(self):\n        return self.w + [self.b] # this function just return all the parameters of our neuron\n\nAnd, its just it, a completely and functional artificial neuron, or at least after we implement the tahn (tangent hyperbolic) function. It’s formula is: \\[\n\\tanh(x) = \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}\n\\]\nNote that there is 3 operations that we don’t implement to make this, so, lets implement them. For know, I presume that you understand how to implement this, so, try your self, you can search in google for this, just don’t use an llm.\n\n\nShow solution:\nimport math\n# Its not really necessery to add exp, subtraction or divided, but its good with you do 😊\ndef tahn(self):\n    x = self.data\n    t = (math.exp(x) - math.exp(-x))/ (math.exp(x) + math.exp(-x))\n    out = Value(t, (self,), \"tahn\")\n\n    # We can derivate, or just pick up on google\n    def _backwards():\n        self.grad = (1 - t**2) * out.grad\n    \n    out._backward = _backward\n    return out\n\n\nKnow, lets test if this are working\n\nx = Value(10)\n\ny = x.tahn()\ny.backward()\ny.data, y.grad, x.data, x.grad\n\n(0.9999999958776926, 1, 10, 8.244614768671e-09)\n\n\nWorks pretty well. Let’s try the neuron\n\nn = Neuron(2)\nx = [2, 3, 4]\nout = n(x)\nprint(out, n.parameters())\n\nValue(data=0.9990069731166361) [Value(data=0.8845385329920525), Value(data=0.8690899811172499), Value(data=-0.572645326722703)]\n\n\nWorks, lets move on.\n\n\nBuilding a Layer\nSo, we already create an simple Neuron, now, we just need to line them up for make a Layer.\n\nclass Layer:\n    def __init__(self, input_num, output_num):\n        self.neurons = [Neuron(input_num) for _ in range(output_num)] # Create a list of neurons that accept input_num variables in input, and will generate output_num outputs\n\n    # Just process all operations in all neurons with the input\n    def __call__(self,x):\n        out = [n(x) for n in self.neurons]\n        return out[0] if len(out) == 1 else out\n    \n    def parameters(self):\n        out = []\n        for neuron in self.neurons:\n            out.extend(neuron.parameters()) # Add the values in an unique list\n        return out\n\nLet’s test if this work\n\nx = [2, 3, 4]\n\nlayer = Layer(3,3)\nlayer(x), layer.parameters()\n\n([Value(data=-0.9975466445997095),\n  Value(data=-0.8603898088861367),\n  Value(data=-0.5739890823985446)],\n [Value(data=0.9249624324965577),\n  Value(data=-0.9749603785977712),\n  Value(data=-0.32069397451830506),\n  Value(data=-0.9933770261971591),\n  Value(data=0.9941546654131326),\n  Value(data=-0.3483923319648241),\n  Value(data=-0.39441769044095243),\n  Value(data=-0.6603051379217166),\n  Value(data=0.20324908566243227),\n  Value(data=-0.6129587525230566),\n  Value(data=0.37162697255269683),\n  Value(data=-0.7075815632792295)])\n\n\nWork well, this is pretty simple too. Now let’s move to the last part, create an complete Artificial Neural Network\n\n\nBuilding an MLP\nFor last, we will create a Multilayer Perceptron, for this, we just need to to line layer up.\n\nclass MLP:\n    def __init__(self, input_num, outputs_nums):\n        self.layers = []\n        values = [input_num] + outputs_nums\n        for id in range(len(outputs_nums)): # This work for create an unique list used to describe input and output for all layers\n            self.layers.append(Layer(values[id], values[id+1]))\n\n    def __call__(self, X):\n        for layer in self.layers: # This works because with exception from the first, each layer just receive the input from the last layer\n            X = layer(X)\n        return X\n\n    def parameters(self):\n        out = []\n        for layer in self.layers:\n            out.extend(layer.parameters())\n        return out\n\nAnd, its finish, just need to test now\n\nnn = MLP(3, [6,6,1])\nx = [2, 3, 4]\n\nnn(x) # You can test the parameters\n\nValue(data=0.9181094920083286)\n\n\n\n\nTraining our neural network\nIn the last part, we create a MLP, but we don’t fit them in any data. Lets creat a function and values with some noise\n\nimport random\n\ndef f(x,y,z):\n    return 0.04*x**2 + 0.07*y*x - z + random.gauss(0, 1)\n\nX = []\ny = []\nfor i in range(100):\n    X.append([random.uniform(-5,5) for _ in range(3)])\n    y.append(f(X[i][0],X[i][1],X[i][2]))\n\nTo implement the train loop, we will need one more thing, there is an loss functions, this is just an metric that describes how well our model are fitting in data. For these case, we will use Mean Squared Error, so the steps for the training loop, its, calc the prediction, calc the loss, calc the gradients, subtract the gradients from the weights, reset the gradients values (our code accumulate the gradients) and do it again, and again.\n\nann = MLP(3, [8,8,1])\n\nfor i in range(100): # Our code will do 100 epochs of training\n    y_pred = [ann(x) for x in X] # Our model only accept one prediction per time\n    loss = sum((pred-origin)**2 for pred,origin in zip(y_pred, y))\n\n    loss.backward() # Calc of gradients\n\n    for p in ann.parameters():\n        p.data = p.data - 0.001*p.grad # Updating weights, we multiply the gradient by a small number called learning rate, we do this for not have problems with model convergence\n        p.grad = 0\n    print(f\"Epoch {i}, Loss: {loss}\")\n\nEpoch 0, Loss: Value(data=1051.2949882986056)\nEpoch 1, Loss: Value(data=923.4902588148647)\nEpoch 2, Loss: Value(data=791.3205833402908)\nEpoch 3, Loss: Value(data=606.923291174209)\nEpoch 4, Loss: Value(data=566.8920785836017)\nEpoch 5, Loss: Value(data=558.2112058055417)\nEpoch 6, Loss: Value(data=552.9211008496376)\nEpoch 7, Loss: Value(data=549.0125731979632)\nEpoch 8, Loss: Value(data=545.865828747848)\nEpoch 9, Loss: Value(data=543.2254633947665)\nEpoch 10, Loss: Value(data=540.9651547940884)\nEpoch 11, Loss: Value(data=539.0107157210807)\nEpoch 12, Loss: Value(data=537.3103936898699)\nEpoch 13, Loss: Value(data=535.823604938972)\nEpoch 14, Loss: Value(data=534.5172883519647)\nEpoch 15, Loss: Value(data=533.3645537607747)\nEpoch 16, Loss: Value(data=532.3435684101173)\nEpoch 17, Loss: Value(data=531.4364333032352)\nEpoch 18, Loss: Value(data=530.6282263807801)\nEpoch 19, Loss: Value(data=529.906277910882)\nEpoch 20, Loss: Value(data=529.2596524503496)\nEpoch 21, Loss: Value(data=528.6787999332045)\nEpoch 22, Loss: Value(data=528.1553376731289)\nEpoch 23, Loss: Value(data=527.6819184969505)\nEpoch 24, Loss: Value(data=527.2521410668172)\nEpoch 25, Loss: Value(data=526.8604710081507)\nEpoch 26, Loss: Value(data=526.5021580586933)\nEpoch 27, Loss: Value(data=526.1731470283877)\nEpoch 28, Loss: Value(data=525.8699864324543)\nEpoch 29, Loss: Value(data=525.5897398761521)\nEpoch 30, Loss: Value(data=525.3299041814302)\nEpoch 31, Loss: Value(data=525.0883366152775)\nEpoch 32, Loss: Value(data=524.8631921896257)\nEpoch 33, Loss: Value(data=524.6528710316994)\nEpoch 34, Loss: Value(data=524.4559752076543)\nEpoch 35, Loss: Value(data=524.2712740139098)\nEpoch 36, Loss: Value(data=524.0976765505235)\nEpoch 37, Loss: Value(data=523.9342103151313)\nEpoch 38, Loss: Value(data=523.7800045799114)\nEpoch 39, Loss: Value(data=523.6342774179062)\nEpoch 40, Loss: Value(data=523.4963254056153)\nEpoch 41, Loss: Value(data=523.3655152193421)\nEpoch 42, Loss: Value(data=523.2412765370021)\nEpoch 43, Loss: Value(data=523.1230958337383)\nEpoch 44, Loss: Value(data=523.0105108054325)\nEpoch 45, Loss: Value(data=522.9031052638385)\nEpoch 46, Loss: Value(data=522.800504422061)\nEpoch 47, Loss: Value(data=522.7023705349505)\nEpoch 48, Loss: Value(data=522.6083988828914)\nEpoch 49, Loss: Value(data=522.5183140965106)\nEpoch 50, Loss: Value(data=522.4318668200312)\nEpoch 51, Loss: Value(data=522.3488307067473)\nEpoch 52, Loss: Value(data=522.2689997344307)\nEpoch 53, Loss: Value(data=522.1921858231358)\nEpoch 54, Loss: Value(data=522.1182167337126)\nEpoch 55, Loss: Value(data=522.0469342227007)\nEpoch 56, Loss: Value(data=521.9781924280293)\nEpoch 57, Loss: Value(data=521.9118564599281)\nEpoch 58, Loss: Value(data=521.8478011723306)\nEpoch 59, Loss: Value(data=521.7859100915276)\nEpoch 60, Loss: Value(data=521.7260744807019)\nEpoch 61, Loss: Value(data=521.668192520975)\nEpoch 62, Loss: Value(data=521.6121685916504)\nEpoch 63, Loss: Value(data=521.557912634261)\nEpoch 64, Loss: Value(data=521.5053395868107)\nEpoch 65, Loss: Value(data=521.4543688761596)\nEpoch 66, Loss: Value(data=521.4049239578216)\nEpoch 67, Loss: Value(data=521.356931893515)\nEpoch 68, Loss: Value(data=521.3103229575952)\nEpoch 69, Loss: Value(data=521.265030264012)\nEpoch 70, Loss: Value(data=521.2209894056319)\nEpoch 71, Loss: Value(data=521.1781380976365)\nEpoch 72, Loss: Value(data=521.136415816148)\nEpoch 73, Loss: Value(data=521.0957634222322)\nEpoch 74, Loss: Value(data=521.0561227597639)\nEpoch 75, Loss: Value(data=521.0174362132178)\nEpoch 76, Loss: Value(data=520.9796462078906)\nEpoch 77, Loss: Value(data=520.9426946300249)\nEpoch 78, Loss: Value(data=520.906522137112)\nEpoch 79, Loss: Value(data=520.8710673183747)\nEpoch 80, Loss: Value(data=520.8362656506391)\nEpoch 81, Loss: Value(data=520.8020481732336)\nEpoch 82, Loss: Value(data=520.7683397737756)\nEpoch 83, Loss: Value(data=520.7350569290403)\nEpoch 84, Loss: Value(data=520.7021046725919)\nEpoch 85, Loss: Value(data=520.6693724483112)\nEpoch 86, Loss: Value(data=520.63672833086)\nEpoch 87, Loss: Value(data=520.604010806012)\nEpoch 88, Loss: Value(data=520.5710168263171)\nEpoch 89, Loss: Value(data=520.5374840454269)\nEpoch 90, Loss: Value(data=520.5030637126539)\nEpoch 91, Loss: Value(data=520.4672781410886)\nEpoch 92, Loss: Value(data=520.4294518609698)\nEpoch 93, Loss: Value(data=520.3885962493517)\nEpoch 94, Loss: Value(data=520.3432085826756)\nEpoch 95, Loss: Value(data=520.2909066698585)\nEpoch 96, Loss: Value(data=520.2277324007282)\nEpoch 97, Loss: Value(data=520.1467557102727)\nEpoch 98, Loss: Value(data=520.0351363481948)\nEpoch 99, Loss: Value(data=519.867738678577)\n\n\nWork, but not very well, it’s possible to improve this changing the activation function by an ReLU.
